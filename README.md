## üîê Overview

ZipLock is a modern, secure password manager that stores your credentials in a single encrypted 7z archive file. Built with a focus on security, portability, and user control, ZipLock ensures your sensitive data remains encrypted and under your complete control.

Unlike cloud-based password managers, ZipLock gives you full ownership of your data. Your encrypted password database is a single file that you can store anywhere - on your local drive, in your preferred cloud storage service, or on a USB drive. This approach provides maximum flexibility while maintaining the highest security standards.

### Why ZipLock?

- **üîí Your Data, Your Control**: No cloud dependencies, no vendor lock-in
- **üì¶ True Portability**: Single encrypted file you can store anywhere
- **üõ°Ô∏è Zero Knowledge**: Your master key never leaves your device
- **üîì Open Source**: Fully auditable code under Apache 2.0 license
- **üåê Cross-Platform**: Native apps for all major platforms

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Security First
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Military-grade encryption with robust key derivation using Argon2
- **Secure Memory Management**: Master key stored only in memory, never persisted to disk
- **Auto-Lock Protection**: Configurable timeout to automatically lock your vault
- **File Locking**: Prevents concurrent access and data corruption during sync operations

### Powerful Organization
- **Full-Text Search**: Search across all credential fields instantly
- **Smart Tagging**: Organize credentials with custom tags for easy filtering

- **Configurable Compression**: Advanced 7z compression with solid compression and multi-threading
- **Backup Management**: Automatic backup rotation with configurable retention
- **Cross-Device Sync**: Use any file sync service (Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud, etc.)

## üéØ User Experience

ZipLock is designed to be intuitive and efficient for both new users and power users:

### First-Time Setup
1. **Create Your Vault**: Choose a strong master passphrase with real-time strength validation
2. **Select Storage Location**: Pick where to store your encrypted database file

- **Audit Trail**: Track when credentials were last accessed or modified

## üì± Platform Support

ZipLock follows a unified architecture with native applications calling a shared core library directly:

| Platform | Status | Technology | Features |
|----------|--------|------------|----------|
| **Linux** | ‚úÖ Stable | Rust + iced/GTK4 | Full desktop experience, Wayland support |
| **Windows** | üìã Planned | Rust + Tauri | Native Windows integration |
| **iOS** | üìã Planned | Swift + SwiftUI | Direct FFI integration with shared core |
| **Android** | üöß In Development | Kotlin + Jetpack Compose | Direct FFI integration with shared core |
| **macOS** | üìã Planned | Swift + SwiftUI | Native macOS experience |

### Architecture Benefits
- **Direct Integration**: Lightweight apps with direct access to core functionality
- **Secure Core**: All cryptographic operations handled by memory-safe Rust library
- **Consistent Experience**: Single implementation ensures identical behavior across platforms
- **Platform Native**: Each client uses platform-specific UI technologies with shared business logic

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

ZipLock follows a unified architecture with direct FFI integration for maximum portability and simplicity:
