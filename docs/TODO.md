# TODO

- Taking into consideration the spec in `docs` and the current root README.md file. Can you please remove references to the "ZipLock team" and "https://ziplock.app" as these don't exist. For now, just credit the app to "James Angus <james@ejangi.com>".
- Taking in to consideration the spec docs in `docs` directory, can you please ensure that the specification for all config files in the repository and also in the user's directory use yaml format, not toml? Toml should only be used for the rust project configuration, not for the config files used by the frontend and backend apps when running.
