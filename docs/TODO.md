# TODO

Run one of the following prompts in Zed's agent panel and when you're ready to bump the version, use `./scripts/version/update-version.sh patch "<My feature update here>"`:

- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, should we look at making the IpcClient a shared component with C-bindings for use in other languages?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you ensure that when the backend first connects to a repository that it runs validations against the archive and it's contents to ensure that the archive is valid and that the contents are not corrupted? I believe there are already methods for validation that are currently reporting is unused when we build the backend.
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you hook up the one-time password field so that it stores the value, but once it has a value it displays the 6 digit code? I'm assuming there is some kind of algorithm that takes the key and can translate it into a 6 digit code that refreshes every 30 seconds? So, we might need a shared utility function(s) for that. This field will also need the visibility toggle button next to it so we can toggle between the 6 digit generated code and then underlying stored key.
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files can you hook up the search box on the frontend view that lists the credentials? I want it to operate on pressing enter on the keyboard and it should filter the list of credentials to just those that match the search term.
