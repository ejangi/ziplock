# TODO

- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can we ensure that for secure notes we are using a textarea/editor, not just a simple one line text input?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, should we look at making the IpcClient a shared component with C-bindings for use in other languages?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you ensure that all buttons and text inputs have their appearance definitions in the ziplock/frontend/linux/src/ui/theme.rs file and consolidate the styles so there is one text input style across the whole application and the buttons are consistent in their border, padding and text sizes. The only difference with the buttons should be the buttons types where the default is a white background, primary brand colour border and text colour also uses the primary brand colour. There is also a primary button type that uses the primary brand colour for both the border and background, while the text is white. There is also a danger button type that uses the brand red colour for the background color and border colour, while the text remains white. We can use this danger button type for delete actions. Ensure each button type has hover states.
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you used the Iced Toast component to ensure the linux frontend application has a master toast component that all user messages are sent to? It should use theme.rs file to define the different styles for Info, Warning, Alert/Error, etc. Please move all user presented messages to use this new toast component.
