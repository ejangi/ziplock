# TODO

- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can we ensure that for secure notes we are using a textarea/editor, not just a simple one line text input?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, should we look at making the IpcClient a shared component with C-bindings for use in other languages?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, on the view with the list of credentials, can you remove the timestamp. Can you move the delete credential button to the edit credential view instead? On the list of credentials page, can you make it so that clicking on the box that borders around a single credential, if the user clicks it will open that credential for editing?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you make sure all buttons have a 10px rounded border? Can you also make sure they consistently have 20px of padding?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you ensure that the app is saving the values for each credential back to the backend and it's getting saved by the backend in the repository in the relevant record.yml file? At the moment, when I open a credential the fields are blank.
