# TODO

- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, should we look at making the IpcClient a shared component with C-bindings for use in other languages?
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you used the Iced Toast component to ensure the linux frontend application has a master toast component that all user messages are sent to? It should use theme.rs file to define the different styles for Info, Warning, Alert/Error, etc. Please move all user presented messages to use this new toast component.
