# TODO

Run one of the following prompts in Zed's agent panel and when you're ready to bump the version, use `./scripts/version/update-version.sh patch "<My feature update here>"`:

- Taking into consideration `docs/design.md`, I want to replace the title of the add_credential input page from being "Add New Credential" to just having the Title input field. However I want the title input field to have a larger font that other inputs and also have larger padding than other inputs. That way it stands out more. Be sure to implement this styling in the `theme.rs` file. Similarly, on the edit credential input page, I want the replace the title "Edit: <Credential Title>" with the same title input field. For both title fields, can you put the relevant credential type (CommonTemplates) icon left of the input field? On the List Credentials page, we can remove the "Type: <insert credential type here>" text from each button and instead include the credential type icon on the left of the button.
- Taking into consideration `docs/technical/build.md`, can you implement a "check for updates" feature that looks for new releases? Does this kind of feature usually just check the github releases or does it need to know which app store the app was installed from?
- Taking into consideration `docs/*.md` docs, can you implement the clipboard timeout feature in the app so that after a TOTP code or password is copied to the clipboard the app clears the clipboard? This feature should honour the config setting clipboard_timeout which is the number of seconds to count down from.
- Taking into consideration `docs/technical/build.md` and `.github/workflows/linux-build.yml`, can you ensure that release notes not only have the installation instructions for Ubuntu/Debian, but also build from source and also Arch/Manjaro?
- Taking into consideration `docs/technical/build.md` and `.github/workflows/linux-build.yml`, can you please ensure that the Arch PKGBUILD file sets the correct `sha256sums` value? Right now this value is `sha256sums=('SKIP')  # This should be updated for each release` Also, `pkgver` is not being set to the correct version number either.
