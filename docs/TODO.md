# TODO

Run one of the following prompts in Zed's agent panel and when you're ready to bump the version, use `./scripts/version/update-version.sh patch "<My feature update here>"`:

- Taking into consideration `docs/technical/build.md`, `docs/architecture.md` and `.github/workflows/linux-build.yml`, can you please evaluate each github workflow job and step to make the whole process more efficient and faster? At the moment, I feel that it is rebuilding the project several times and taking a long time to complete. For one, I may need you to explain why we do "Test Suite (stable)" AND "Test Suite (beta)". Happy for things to remain if you think they are necessary. But, to my eyes, it seems as though the whole workflow just builds the project many times. There also seems to be inconsistencies between the local `scripts/build/*` scripts runs and the actual github workflow runs (github workflow will fail where the local scripts succeed).
- Can you please `cargo check` this app, look at each of the warnings and work out how to correct them? We have a shared library, so any functionality where it could be shared between platforms we should move into that location. We also need to evaluate whether each item in the warnings should still exist and is just not being used correctly. If the functionality really is redundant then please remove it.
