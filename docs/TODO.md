# TODO

- Taking in to consideration the spec docs in `docs` directory, can you please update the README.md platform support table to show Linux as In Development, and all other platforms as Planned?
- Taking in to consideration the spec docs in `docs` directory, is it possible for the iOS and Android platforms to work with the shared libraries? If not, do we need to provide C-bindings so that we can include this shared implementation on those platforms? If that also is not possible, then I guess worst case scenario we just need to implement those shared libraries in the iOS and Android platform languages. We won't do that right not, but I just wanted to get your perspective on what is possible?
