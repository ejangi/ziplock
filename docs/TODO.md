# TODO

Run one of the following prompts in Zed's agent panel and when you're ready to bump the version, use `./scripts/version/update-version.sh patch "<My feature update here>"`:

- Taking into consideration `docs/design.md`, `docs/technical/configuration.md` and `shared/src/config/mod.rs`, can you create a `Settings` UI page (that is triggered by the Settings button in the main menu) and set up relevant fields on that page to make editing the configuration file easy for the user. I think config parameters like recent_repositories don't make sense to have a user editable UI. Happy for you to suggest other parameters that should not be editable by the user. Be mindful that we will need to add validation to what the user enters in case they input something invalid or unexpected.
- Taking into consideration `docs/design.md`, I want to replace the title of the add_credential input page from being "Add New Credential" to just having the Title input field. However I want the title input field to have a larger font that other inputs and also have larger padding that other inputs. That way it stands out more. Similarly, on the edit credential input page, I want the replace the title "Edit: <Credential Title>" with the same title input field.
