# TODO

- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you change the "Try Again" button that appears when the user gets the unlock passphrase incorrect so that it takes the user back to the previous screen to try unlocking the repository again? Right now, it takes the user back to a blank form where the repository location has been reset and it slows down the process of trying again.
- Taking into consideration the `ziplock/README.md` and `ziplock/docs/*.md` files, can you now setup the edit credentials view? I think the add credentials view has a nice form for editing the credential record that we could just reuse across both the add_credential and edit_credential views.
