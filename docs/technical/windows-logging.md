# Windows Production Logging Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Windows-specific production logging for ZipLock, ensuring the application runs without a terminal window and routes logs to the Windows Event Viewer in production environments.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Windows Subsystem Configuration

**File**: `apps/desktop/src/main.rs`
- **Change**: Application already has `#![cfg_attr(target_os = "windows", windows_subsystem = "windows")]`
- **Result**: No terminal window appears when running the application in production
- **Verification**: Build script confirms this setting is active in production builds

### 2. Production vs Development Logging Modes

**Files**: 
- `apps/desktop/src/logging/mod.rs`
- `apps/desktop/src/main.rs`

**Changes**:
- Added `enable_event_log` field to `LoggingConfig`
- Created `LoggingConfig::production()` method that:
  - Disables console logging (`enable_console: false`)
  - Enables Windows Event Log (`enable_event_log: true`)
  - Uses minimal log levels (WARN for files, ERROR for console)
- Created `LoggingConfig::development()` method that:
  - Enables console logging for debugging
  - Disables Event Log
  - Uses verbose log levels (DEBUG/TRACE)

**Mode Detection**:
```rust
fn is_production_mode() -> bool {
    std::env::var("ZIPLOCK_PRODUCTION").is_ok() ||
    cfg!(feature = "production") ||
    !cfg!(debug_assertions)
}
```

### 3. Windows Event Log Integration

**File**: `apps/desktop/src/logging/windows_event_log.rs` (NEW)

**Features**:
- PowerShell-based Event Log writing for simplicity and reliability
- Automatic event source registration
- Message cleaning and formatting
- Integration with tracing-subscriber
- Fallback handling for non-Windows platforms

**Key Components**:
- `WindowsEventLogWriter`: Core event log writer
- `EventLogMakeWriter`: tracing-subscriber integration
- `register_event_source()`: PowerShell-based source registration
- Message level mapping: ERROR → Error, WARN → Warning, INFO → Information

### 4. Cargo Configuration Updates

**File**: `apps/desktop/Cargo.toml`

**Added Dependencies**:
```toml
[target.'cfg(windows)'.dependencies]
windows = { version = "0.52", features = [
    "Win32_Foundation",
    "Win32_System_Registry",
    "Win32_System_EventLog",
    "Win32_Security",
    "Win32_UI_Shell",
] }
regex = "1.10"  # For log message cleaning

[features]
production = ["minimal-logging", "event-logging"]
minimal-logging = []
event-logging = []
```

### 5. Build System Integration

**Files**:
- `apps/desktop/build.rs`
- `.github/workflows/unified-release.yml`
- `packaging/windows/scripts/register-event-source.ps1` (NEW)

**Changes**:
- Build script detects production mode and shows appropriate warnings
- GitHub Actions builds with `--features production` and `ZIPLOCK_PRODUCTION=1`
- Added PowerShell script for Event Log source registration during MSI installation

### 6. PowerShell Event Log Management

**File**: `packaging/windows/scripts/register-event-source.ps1` (NEW)

**Features**:
- Register/unregister ZipLock as Windows Event Log source
- Requires administrator privileges
- Comprehensive error handling
- Test event generation to verify registration

## Usage

### Development Mode
```bash
cargo run
# or
cargo build
```
- Shows console output with DEBUG/TRACE level logging
- No Event Log integration
- Terminal-friendly for debugging

### Production Mode
```bash
# Environment variable approach
set ZIPLOCK_PRODUCTION=1
cargo run --release

# Feature flag approach
cargo build --release --features production

# GitHub Actions builds automatically use production mode
```
- No console window appears
- Minimal logging to files (WARN level)
- Events logged to Windows Event Viewer under "Application" log
- Source: "ZipLock"

### Event Log Source Registration

**Manual Registration** (requires Administrator):
```powershell
.\packaging\windows\scripts\register-event-source.ps1 -Action install
```

**Removal**:
```powershell
.\packaging\windows\scripts\register-event-source.ps1 -Action uninstall
```

**MSI Installation**: Automatically registers the event source during installation.

## Viewing Events

1. Open **Event Viewer** (eventvwr.exe)
2. Navigate to **Windows Logs** → **Application**
3. Filter by **Source**: "ZipLock"
4. Event IDs: 1000 (generic application events)

## Implementation Benefits

### ✅ Production Ready
- **No Terminal Window**: Application runs as proper Windows GUI app
- **Professional Logging**: Events appear in Windows Event Viewer alongside other system events
- **System Administrator Friendly**: Centralized logging location familiar to IT professionals
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: Lightweight PowerShell-based implementation

### ✅ Developer Friendly  
- **Development Mode**: Full console logging with DEBUG/TRACE levels
- **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration needed
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation if Event Log registration fails
- **Cross-Platform**: No impact on Linux/macOS builds

### ✅ Enterprise Integration
- **Group Policy Compatible**: Event sources can be managed via Group Policy
- **SIEM Integration**: Events can be collected by enterprise monitoring systems
- **Audit Trail**: Application events are permanently logged and auditable
- **Service Integration**: Proper integration with Windows Service ecosystem

## Architecture Decisions

### Why PowerShell Instead of Direct Windows API?
1. **Simplicity**: Avoids complex Windows API marshaling and error handling
2. **Reliability**: PowerShell cmdlets handle edge cases and permissions automatically  
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to understand and modify than low-level API calls
4. **Compatibility**: Works across different Windows versions without API changes

### Why Feature-Based Production Detection?
1. **Explicit Control**: Clear intention when building for production
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Easy to enable in automated build pipelines
3. **Environment Flexibility**: Can override via environment variables
4. **Debug Safety**: Debug builds never accidentally run in production mode

## Testing

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test development mode
cargo run
# Should show console output

# Test production mode  
set ZIPLOCK_PRODUCTION=1
cargo run --release --features production
# Should show no console, check Event Viewer for events

# Test Event Log registration
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "packaging\windows\scripts\register-event-source.ps1" -Action install
```

### Verification Checklist
- [ ] No terminal window appears in production builds
- [ ] Events appear in Windows Event Viewer under Application log
- [ ] Development builds still show console output
- [ ] MSI installer registers event source successfully
- [ ] Application starts correctly in both modes
- [ ] Log files are created with appropriate levels

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Custom Event IDs**: Different event IDs for different message types
2. **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted event data
3. **Performance Counters**: Windows Performance Counter integration  
4. **ETW Integration**: Event Tracing for Windows support
5. **WMI Integration**: Management instrumentation for monitoring

### Configuration Options
1. **Event Log Channel**: Allow custom event log selection (not just Application)
2. **Event Source Name**: Configurable event source name
3. **Log Level Filtering**: More granular Event Log level control
4. **Message Formatting**: Customizable event message templates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Event Log Source Registration Fails**:
- Ensure running as Administrator
- Check if source name conflicts with existing sources
- Verify PowerShell execution policy allows script execution

**No Events in Event Viewer**:
- Verify application is running in production mode
- Check Event Log source exists: `Get-EventLog -List`
- Ensure Event Log service is running

**Application Won't Start**:
- Check for missing Visual C++ runtime (included in MSI)
- Verify Windows version compatibility
- Check antivirus software blocking execution

**MSI Installation Issues**:
- Run as Administrator for system-wide installation
- Ensure WiX toolset is available for MSI creation
- Check Windows Installer service is running

### Debug Commands

```powershell
# Check if event source exists
[System.Diagnostics.EventLog]::SourceExists('ZipLock')

# List all event log sources
Get-EventLog -List

# View recent ZipLock events
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source ZipLock -Newest 10

# Test event writing
Write-EventLog -LogName Application -Source ZipLock -EntryType Information -EventId 1000 -Message "Test message"
```
